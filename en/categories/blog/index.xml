        <description>5-April-2020
Yeah! I missed day10. I was solving some codechef long challenege problems.
Today also I was doing the same. For the first time I was venturing out to problems beyond first two problems. I was surprsied to find that problems were not of an alien concept. No doubt they are difficult to crack even now. But atleast I can think in a direction &amp;amp; try. They are mostly mathematical based with use of tricks to minimise computations at times.</description>

It was quite frustrating day. I could&amp;rsquo;nt solve a very simple problem on codechef which gkcs had done with a very few attempts. It was just breaking my spirit by each passing minute. So, I decided to taka a break.
I watched a youtube channel called shiey. Amazing guy. He was train surfing in cargo trains in Ukraine. The real subway surfer. He would climb on to appopiate trains to reach Black sea at the end.</description>

        <description>2-April-2020
I was in a delusion since morning. Whether I should leave Directi or not. Nishant often tries to confuse. I was trying to get away from my decison by sleeping in the dat time &amp;amp; watching a lot of TV instead of solving problems. Upgrad guy called back trying to confirm whether I am still interested. I said yes. Why shouldn&amp;rsquo;t I? They are paying more. But yeah, I would get swayed awayed a little from the path.</description>

April fool banaya!
Day was not very special or something to be told off.
I spent most of my time wandering from one goal to other. I think I have a fundamental flaw. I don&amp;rsquo;t have a single goal. And ofcouse it&amp;rsquo;s not 10x.
Within a week from today,
Graphs:
&amp;ndash; finding cycles
All those previous test questions.
I believe the question bank is a small collection of questions. They just change a few things here &amp;amp; there.</description>

It was an unusual day. Atleast it felt so. An unknown calm was lurking around since morning.
I wanted to do backtracking questions today. But during question selection I lost myself to dp problem of rod cutting. Everywhere on internet they advocated bottom up approach which is still hard for me to comprehend. But, I think I won;t be able to complete everything without it. So, I&amp;rsquo;ll try again maybe with a different question.</description>

        <description>30-April-2018
Head started the day with Computer networks. I was searching for the answer to, &amp;ldquo;What happens when you hit google.co?&amp;rdquo; Maybe I would like to explain it once.
This happened till before lunch. This took so much time but I won&amp;rsquo;t have to do it again.
Post lunch I was overwhelmed with acheivements of the day &amp;amp; rested on some laureals. That proved to be time waster. Later before evening I tried to do something productive when the thought to make hugo blog crossed me.</description>
