[{"content":"5-April-2020\nYeah! I missed day10. I was solving some codechef long challenege problems.\nToday also I was doing the same. For the first time I was venturing out to problems beyond first two problems. I was surprsied to find that problems were not of an alien concept. No doubt they are difficult to crack even now. But atleast I can think in a direction \u0026amp; try. They are mostly mathematical based with use of tricks to minimise computations at times. Since, I haven\u0026rsquo;t yet figure out them I can only guess as of now.\nWatched a series on North Korea. The person covering the documentary was from Russia. Upon returning back to his homeland even the russian was feeling librated. I always complained why my grandfathers didn\u0026rsquo;t run to Americas or Europe so that I would have born in a decent country. But now it felt like India atleast gurantees so much freedom for free which we often take for granted.\nHoping to continue with long challenge for can\u0026rsquo;t take it as mainstream. Hopefully tomorrow Upgrad will release the offer.\n","description":"countless days of lockdown","id":2,"section":"posts","tags":["corona"],"title":"Day 11 - lockdown","uri":"http://example.org/en/posts/lockdown_day11/"},{"content":"3-April-2020\nIt was quite frustrating day. I could\u0026rsquo;nt solve a very simple problem on codechef which gkcs had done with a very few attempts. It was just breaking my spirit by each passing minute. So, I decided to taka a break.\nI watched a youtube channel called shiey. Amazing guy. He was train surfing in cargo trains in Ukraine. The real subway surfer. He would climb on to appopiate trains to reach Black sea at the end. What a normadic \u0026amp; crude approach!\nAfter that I started solving April challenge in the evening. Still figuring out the first problem. Though second one gave me a green tick which injected ecstacy back into me. Was figuring out the third question when lights out time approached.\nBye!\n","description":"countless days of lockdown","id":3,"section":"posts","tags":["corona"],"title":"Day 10 - lockdown","uri":"http://example.org/en/posts/lockdown_day10/"},{"content":"2-April-2020\nI was in a delusion since morning. Whether I should leave Directi or not. Nishant often tries to confuse. I was trying to get away from my decison by sleeping in the dat time \u0026amp; watching a lot of TV instead of solving problems. Upgrad guy called back trying to confirm whether I am still interested. I said yes. Why shouldn\u0026rsquo;t I? They are paying more. But yeah, I would get swayed awayed a little from the path.\nI wanted to be a product guy. Not necessarily product manager but someone who builds \u0026amp; launches features to the market. What an irony that I have not yet delpoyed any single thing yet and writing about it. The whole idea of coming here was about this. But what shall I do. Money is where the cookie crumbles. There I would continue to learn DS \u0026amp; Algo. I know for sure that that\u0026rsquo;s the only skill everybody is looking right now \u0026amp; even Directi will take me in full time if I have it even anytime in future.\nI think I have become a lot comfortable here. That is bad. For months I am trying to make myself busy with stuff \u0026amp; delay this very thought of decaying time. I think if I would have been in good hands it might not be that case. Still going with the flow it seems. I need 10x rule to rescue.\n","description":"countless days of lockdown","id":4,"section":"posts","tags":["corona"],"title":"Day 9 - lockdown","uri":"http://example.org/en/posts/lockdown_day9/"},{"content":"1-April-2020\nApril fool banaya!\nDay was not very special or something to be told off.\nI spent most of my time wandering from one goal to other. I think I have a fundamental flaw. I don\u0026rsquo;t have a single goal. And ofcouse it\u0026rsquo;s not 10x.\nWithin a week from today,\nGraphs:\n\u0026ndash; finding cycles\nAll those previous test questions.\nI believe the question bank is a small collection of questions. They just change a few things here \u0026amp; there.\nI now need to finish the geeksforgeeks page at the earliest.\nAchievements:\nDid 20 burpees \u0026amp; 200 skips\nDid more than half of codechefs warm up round\n","description":"countless days of lockdown","id":5,"section":"posts","tags":["corona"],"title":"Day 8 - lockdown","uri":"http://example.org/en/posts/lockdown_day8/"},{"content":"31-April-2019\nIt was an unusual day. Atleast it felt so. An unknown calm was lurking around since morning.\nI wanted to do backtracking questions today. But during question selection I lost myself to dp problem of rod cutting. Everywhere on internet they advocated bottom up approach which is still hard for me to comprehend. But, I think I won;t be able to complete everything without it. So, I\u0026rsquo;ll try again maybe with a different question. So, all this happened till lunch.\nAfter lunch my laptop was busy with didi. So, I decided to grab this opportunity to read computer networks. My goal was to look at all headers of various layers to know better about the tight packing happenning. I ended up reading more about http, smtp etc which further strengthened my concepts. I refrained away from Transport layer as it was looking less attractive at that hour. But I ended up reading RSA encyption algorithm. They I still will find it hard to replicate but can surely satisfy someone about it\u0026rsquo;s richness \u0026amp; usefulness.\nAfter that I went for a walk in the evening. I figured out that Ranchit Jain from iitr is has made a new account on codechef recently in 2017. He says that he started coding in 4th semester which must be somewhere in 2015. But it\u0026rsquo;s not like that. His first submission is in 2017. Maybe he doesn\u0026rsquo;t want us to see his real struggle. Found that gkcs on codechef is genuine \u0026amp; can be followed.\nAfter some timepass it rang that codeforces round was about to start at 7. But it was also time to fetch papa. Came home after sometime \u0026amp; started. Problem A seemed easy but only after a number of iterations of reading the question again \u0026amp; again. But still I could\u0026rsquo;nt solve it. Damn! What am I doing wrong? Am I doing too much competition in premature stage itself? Let me solve a lot of problems then.\nEnded up eating food after watching Ramayan. Peace for the day. Progressing very slowly.\nAcheivements:\nComputer networks: http, RSA\nRod cutting DP attempted unsuccessfully\n","description":"Blog of day 7","id":6,"section":"posts","tags":["corona"],"title":"Day 7 of lockdown","uri":"http://example.org/en/posts/lockdown_day7/"},{"content":"30-April-2018\nHead started the day with Computer networks. I was searching for the answer to, \u0026ldquo;What happens when you hit google.co?\u0026rdquo; Maybe I would like to explain it once.\nThis happened till before lunch. This took so much time but I won\u0026rsquo;t have to do it again.\nPost lunch I was overwhelmed with acheivements of the day \u0026amp; rested on some laureals. That proved to be time waster. Later before evening I tried to do something productive when the thought to make hugo blog crossed me. It took an hour or so \u0026amp; was futile.\nThen, I decided to solve some problems from past interviews. It was again a little demoralizing. Then came time to pick up dadyji \u0026amp; it was already post evening.\nCame home \u0026amp; can\u0026rsquo;t remember anything but the 9pm Ramayan wigth food.\nLittle acheived.\n","description":"Blog of day 6","id":7,"section":"posts","tags":["corona"],"title":"Day 6 of lockdown","uri":"http://example.org/en/posts/lockdown_day6/"},{"content":"Sample images from Pixabay\n","description":"cartoon gallery","id":8,"section":"gallery","tags":null,"title":"Cartoon","uri":"http://example.org/en/gallery/cartoon/"},{"content":"Sample images from Pixabay\n","description":"photo gallery","id":9,"section":"gallery","tags":null,"title":"Photo","uri":"http://example.org/en/gallery/photo/"},{"content":"Written in Go, Hugo is an open source static site generator available under the Apache Licence 2.0.
